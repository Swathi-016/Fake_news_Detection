This project focuses on detecting fake news articles using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques. The goal is to classify news articles as either real or fake based on their textual content.
Features

Data preprocessing and cleaning of text data

Implementation of feature extraction methods (TF-IDF, CountVectorizer)

Training multiple Machine Learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, etc.)

Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Visualization of results for better understanding

Technologies Used

Python

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib / Seaborn

Results

Achieved high accuracy in detecting fake news using supervised learning models.

Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes showed strong performance with balanced precision and recall.

Future Improvements

Use deep learning models (LSTM, BERT) for improved performance.

Deploy as a web application for real-time fake news detection.

Extend dataset for multilingual fake news detection.
